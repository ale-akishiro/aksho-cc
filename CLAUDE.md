# General

## Always

- Always be brutally honest.
- Use `task-master` for tasks, not todo's. I will distinguish between them. Tasks are not todo's, they are different things with different purposes.

## Whenever discussing code

- never change code unless explicitly commanded to
- always suggest multiple code fragments with pros and cons
- always ask questions whenever missing information is required
- always be aware of type signature lies!

## When committing code or interacting with git

- never commit files in the `.git` directory
- never add files in the `.git` directory

## Code Modification Policy

- **NEVER write code without explicit "proceed" or "implement" instruction**
- **Always propose approach first and wait for approval**
- **Separate analysis/planning from implementation phases**
- When expanding tasks or analyzing requirements, DO NOT start coding
- Wait for explicit permission phrases like "proceed", "implement", or "start coding"

## Reminder for Developer

**REMEMBER TO EXPLICITLY REQUEST APPROVAL**: When asking Claude to work on code, always use phrases like:
- "Analyze first, then wait for approval to implement"
- "Propose the approach but don't start coding yet"
- "Show me the plan, then I'll tell you to proceed"
- "DO NOT CODE - just show me what you would do"
